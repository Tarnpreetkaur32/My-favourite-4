        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love my hobby reading of books. I love reading whatever I can get my hands on. Reading is a good hobby because it helps me to learn a lot of things. I read a lot of books; fiction, non-fiction, biography, self-help, instructional, etc. I believe everyone should have a reading hobby.

        <a>My favourite animal is the dog. The dog is a pet animal. It is a four-footed animal. It has two bright eyes. It has two ears, sharp teeth and a small tail. Dogs are of many kinds. Some dogs have fur on their bodies. The dogs are of different colours. They are of different sizes.</a>

        <a>My favourite cartoon is Shin chan. I love him because of his love for mischief. He is a five year old boy. He lives in Japan. He goes to a kindergarten school. He has many friends. His main friends are Kazama, Masao, Nani and Bochan. They have formed a "Kasukabe defense group". Shin chan is the most mischievious of all of them.</a>

He is one of India's most renowned and respected scientist. Sir Abdul Kalam has a huge contribution to India's Space Development and missions. I aim to be a scientist in ISRO. He is an inspiration for me because of his selfless nature and interest in India's advancement. I hope to do something for my country so that the whole world looks at India with even more admiration, just like the way Sir APJ wishes it to be.</a>
